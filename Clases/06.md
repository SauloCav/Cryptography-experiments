# Public key cryptography principles

## Asymmetric encryption
- Public key encryption or asymmetric encryption is a method that uses a key pair, which consists of a private key and a public key.
- Until the 1970s, the only way to encrypt information was through symmetric cryptography.
- To solve the key distribution problem, Diffie and Hellman (1976) introduced the concept of asymmetric cryptography.
- Public key encryption algorithms are very different from symmetric algorithms such as AES or DES.
- Most public key algorithms are based on number theory functions.
- This is quite different from symmetric ciphers, where the goal is generally not to have a compact mathematical description between input and output.
- Although some mathematical structures are often used for small blocks within symmetric ciphers, this does not mean that the whole scheme forms a compact mathematical description.
- Modern symmetric algorithms are safe, fast and widely used. However, there are several limitations associated with symmetric key schemes:
### Key Distribution Problem
• The key must be established between Alice and Bob using a secure channel. <br>
• Sending the key directly through the channel, which would be the most convenient way to transport it, cannot be done.
### Number of Keys
• Even if we solve the key distribution problem, we still need to deal with a very large number of keys. <br>
• If each pair of users needs a separate pair of keys on a network with 𝑛 users, each user needs to store 𝒏 − 𝟏 keys securely.
### Cannot be used to ensure authenticity
• Since Alice and Bob have the same keys because they have the same key, symmetric cryptography cannot be used to guarantee authenticity. <br>
• In some scenarios it is important to prove that Alice really sent a specific message. <br>
• If only symmetric encryption is used and Alice later changes her mind, she can always claim that it was Bob who sent the message.
### To overcome the disadvantages of symmetric cryptography, Diffie and Hellman proposed a revolutionary idea based on the following principle:
• It is not necessary that the key possessed by the person encrypting the message (Alice) be secret. <br>
• The crucial part is that Bob, the receiver, can only decrypt using a secret key. <br>
• To realize such a system, Bob publishes a public encryption key that is known to everyone.
### Basic elements
• A message to be encrypted 𝒎 = {𝒎𝟏, 𝒎𝟐, ..., 𝒎𝒏}, where 𝒎𝒊 is each element of the message in clear text. <br>
• A public key 𝒌𝒑, for each participant, which is shared by the owner or stored in public repositories. <br>
• A private key 𝒌𝒔 corresponding to the public key 𝒌𝒑, for each participant, stored in a secure place, known only to the owner. <br>
• The encryption algorithm 𝑬 that takes the key 𝒌𝒑 and a message 𝒎 and generates a ciphertext, 𝑬(𝒌𝒑, 𝒎) = 𝒄. And the decryption algorithm 𝑫 that takes 𝒌𝒔 and 𝒄 and generates the original text, 𝑫(𝒌𝒔 , 𝒄) = 𝒎.
### Requirements for asymmetric cryptosystems
• Deve ser computacionalmente fácil calcular um par de chaves (𝒌𝒑, 𝒌𝒔). <br>
• Deve ser computacionalmente difícil calcular a chave privada 𝒌𝒔 a partir do conhecimento da chave pública 𝒌𝒑. <br>
• Deve ser computacionalmente fácil para um emissor, conhecendo a chave pública 𝒌𝒑 do receptor, calcular 𝑬(𝒌𝒑, 𝒎) = 𝒄. <br>
• Deve ser computacionalmente difícil para um adversário, conhecendo apenas a chave pública 𝒌𝒑 e um texto cifrado 𝒄 , encontrar a mensagem original 𝒎.
- A problem is computationally easy (or feasible or efficiently computable) if there is an algorithm that can run in polynomial time to solve it.
- On the other hand, a problem is said to be computationally difficult (or infeasible) if there is no known polynomial time algorithm that can solve it.
### Public key cryptography can be used in two scenarios:
#### To ensure confidentiality
• A user (a person or a computing device) is intended to ensure that the message is not accessed by unauthorized persons. <br>
• The sender encrypts the plaintext with the recipient's public key. <br>
• Only the receiver's private key can decrypt the ciphertext. Thus, ensuring confidentiality.
#### To ensure authenticity
• The user wants to authenticate the message, so he uses the public key scheme as a method to obtain a digital signature. <br>
• The sender supplies a message and its private key to a cryptographic algorithm. <br>
• The recipient decrypts the message with the sender's public key. Note that any user with the public key can decrypt the message.
### The basic math problem
• There is a mathematical relationship between the public key and the private key that guarantees that if a message is encrypted with the private key, only the public key can decrypt it.
- The main public key cryptosystems currently used have their security directly related to the difficulty of factoring extremely large integers, such as numbers with more than 150 digits.
- The integer factorization problem consists of finding prime factors of an integer 𝒏, which can be written: 𝒏 = 𝒑𝟏 𝒆𝟏 𝒑𝟐 𝒆𝟐 ⋯ 𝒑𝒏 𝒆𝒏 , where 𝒑𝒏 are distinct primes and each 𝒆𝒊 ≥ 𝟏 is the multiplicity of 𝒑𝒊 .
- So, suppose you know two integers 𝒑 and 𝒒 with more than 100 digits each and you want to calculate the product 𝒏 = 𝒑 ∙ 𝒒.
- It's easy to calculate this result on today's computers.
- However, if given only 𝒏 large enough it is computationally infeasible to find the prime factors 𝒑 and 𝒒 of 𝒏.
### Practical Aspects of Public Key Cryptography
• The big disadvantage, in practice, is that data encryption is very costly in computational terms with public-key algorithms. <br>
• Many block and stream ciphers can cipher from a hundred to a thousand times faster than public key algorithms. <br>
• Thus, in practice, public-key cryptography is rarely used for actual data encryption. <br>
• On the other hand, symmetric algorithms are bad at providing non-repudiation and key establishment functionality. <br>
• To get the best of both worlds, most practical protocols are hybrid protocols that incorporate both symmetric and public-key algorithms.
### Authenticity of public keys
• A big advantage of asymmetric schemes is that we can freely distribute public keys.  <br>
• However, in practice, we have to guarantee the authenticity of the public keys.  <br>
• In other words, how do we know that a certain public key belongs to a certain person?  <br>
• Then comes the need for Public Key Infrastructure.

## Digital certification
- Digital Certification is the technology that adopts security mechanisms, through mathematical algorithms, capable of guaranteeing authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of electronic information.
- Digital certificate is an electronic file stored on digital media that contains the data of its holder, natural or legal person, and associates the public key to said person.
- The digital certificate certifies the identity, guaranteeing authenticity and non-repudiation in commercial and financial transactions signed by them.
- In this way, the digital certificate identifies who we are for people and information systems.
- To ensure legal validity, certificates are issued by entities that are part of a hierarchical chain of trust known as the Public Key Infrastructure.
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) a hierarchical chain of trust that enables the issuance of digital certificates and involves a set of standards and various entities, such as:
• Certification authority, <br>
• Registration authority, <br>
• End Users.
