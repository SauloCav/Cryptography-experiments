# Introduction to modern symmetric cryptography

- Symmetric cryptography is also known as secret key cryptography.
- This encryption method uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message.
- The sender and receiver agree to use a certain key and then share it between them.

## Secure sharing:
- Key sharing needs to be secure, otherwise the entire cryptographic process would be in vain.
- Note that a communication channel is required for sharing the secret key different from the channel used to transmit the encrypted message.
- Thus, one of the great problems of cryptography, known as the key distribution problem, is born.

## Basic scenario:
- In general, a symmetric encryption process can be represented by the following scenario: <br>
• Suppose Alice wants to send a confidential message to Bob. <br>
• Alice knows that the communication channel is not secure, so the message to be sent will be encrypted. <br>
• Alice shares a secret key with Bob. Assume that the key was shared at an earlier point in time.
• The symmetric encryption scheme used by Alice and Bob needs four basic elements: (1) message; (2) key; (3) encryption algorithm, (4) decryption algorithm.

## The key distribution problem: <br>
- Clearly, the big challenge with this method is how to share the secret key securely between the sender and receiver of the message. <br>
• The most natural way to share this key would be to establish communication using another channel deemed secure or a private face-to-face meeting. <br>
• Another way is to make use of a key distribution center, with which users share their secret key.

## Key distribution using a relying party:
- Suppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob, so she encrypts the message using her secret key and sends it to the key distribution center (CDC).
- The CDC, knowing all the secret keys, decrypts the message using Alice's key, then encrypts it again using Bob's key and sends the encrypted message with the new key to Bob. The CDC now has knowledge of all secret messages.
- Now, Bob decrypts the message using his secret key, which is also shared with the CDC.

## Diffie and Hellman Protocol (DH)
- To solve the key distribution problem, Diffie and Hellman (1976) presented a method in which two people can produce a shared secret key by exchanging public information.
- This technique became known as the Diffie-Hellmam key exchange protocol.
- The protocol is not a cryptosystem itself, it is used to generate and share the key securely when using a symmetric cryptographic system.
1. Alice and Bob agree to use a prime number 𝒑 e as the base 𝒈. Both 𝒑 and 𝒈 are public.
2. Alice chooses a secret integer 𝒙 ∈ 𝒁𝒑, and uses it to calculate 𝑿 = 𝒈 𝒙 𝒎𝒐𝒅 𝒑. She then sends 𝑿 to Bob.
3. Bob chooses a secret integer 𝒚 ∈ 𝒁𝒑, and uses it to compute 𝒀 = 𝒈 𝒚 𝒎𝒐𝒅 𝒑. Then send 𝒀 to Alice.
4. Alice calculates the secret secret key 𝑲𝒂 = 𝒀 𝒙 𝒎𝒐𝒅 𝒑
5. Bob calculates the secret key 𝑲𝒃 = 𝑿 𝒚 𝒎𝒐𝒅 �
