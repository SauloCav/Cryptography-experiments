# Introduction to modern symmetric cryptography

- Symmetric cryptography is also known as secret key cryptography.
- This encryption method uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message.
- The sender and receiver agree to use a certain key and then share it between them.

## Secure sharing:
- Key sharing needs to be secure, otherwise the entire cryptographic process would be in vain.
- Note that a communication channel is required for sharing the secret key different from the channel used to transmit the encrypted message.
- Thus, one of the great problems of cryptography, known as the key distribution problem, is born.

## Basic scenario:
- In general, a symmetric encryption process can be represented by the following scenario: <br>
• Suppose Alice wants to send a confidential message to Bob. <br>
• Alice knows that the communication channel is not secure, so the message to be sent will be encrypted. <br>
• Alice shares a secret key with Bob. Assume that the key was shared at an earlier point in time.
• The symmetric encryption scheme used by Alice and Bob needs four basic elements: (1) message; (2) key; (3) encryption algorithm, (4) decryption algorithm.

## The key distribution problem: <br>
- Clearly, the big challenge with this method is how to share the secret key securely between the sender and receiver of the message. <br>
• The most natural way to share this key would be to establish communication using another channel deemed secure or a private face-to-face meeting. <br>
• Another way is to make use of a key distribution center, with which users share their secret key.

## Key distribution using a relying party:
- Suppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob, so she encrypts the message using her secret key and sends it to the key distribution center (CDC).
- The CDC, knowing all the secret keys, decrypts the message using Alice's key, then encrypts it again using Bob's key and sends the encrypted message with the new key to Bob. The CDC now has knowledge of all secret messages.
- Now, Bob decrypts the message using his secret key, which is also shared with the CDC.

## Diffie and Hellman Protocol (DH)
- To solve the key distribution problem, Diffie and Hellman (1976) presented a method in which two people can produce a shared secret key by exchanging public information.
- This technique became known as the Diffie-Hellmam key exchange protocol.
- The protocol is not a cryptosystem itself, it is used to generate and share the key securely when using a symmetric cryptographic system.
1. Alice and Bob agree to use a prime number 𝒑 e as the base 𝒈. Both 𝒑 and 𝒈 are public.
2. Alice chooses a secret integer 𝒙 ∈ 𝒁𝒑, and uses it to calculate 𝑿 = 𝒈 𝒙 𝒎𝒐𝒅 𝒑. She then sends 𝑿 to Bob.
3. Bob chooses a secret integer 𝒚 ∈ 𝒁𝒑, and uses it to compute 𝒀 = 𝒈 𝒚 𝒎𝒐𝒅 𝒑. Then send 𝒀 to Alice.
4. Alice calculates the secret secret key 𝑲𝒂 = 𝒀 𝒙 𝒎𝒐𝒅 𝒑
5. Bob calculates the secret key 𝑲𝒃 = 𝑿 𝒚 𝒎𝒐𝒅 �

## Data Encryption Standard (DES)
- DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that was developed in the 1970s by IBM and designed to be adopted as a standard in the US for business information.
- It was a significant scientific advance in the sense of being the first cryptosystem whose knowledge became public: until then, all algorithms were secret.
- That is, DES security is not based on knowledge of the algorithm but only on knowledge of the secret key.
- DES processes 64-bit plaintext and creates 64-bit ciphertext.
- The function expects a 64-bit key as input. However, only 56 of those bits are used.
- The process takes place in three steps:
• Initial permutation
• rounds
• Final Permutation
- The initial permutation table (IP) of the DES algorithm is a permutation of the 64 bits of the input data block, which rearranges the bits according to a predetermined scheme.
- There are 16 rounds of the same function. The output of the sixteenth round consists of 64 bits in which the left and right halves of the output are swapped to produce the pre-output.
- The DES function applies a 48-bit key to the rightmost 32 bits to produce a 32-bit output.
- This function consists of four sections:
• An expansion P-box,
• A function that adds the round key,
• A group of S-boxes
• A simple P-box
- Generation of subkeys
• Round key generator creates 16 48-bit keys from one 56-bit key.
• However, the cipher key is usually provided as a 64-bit key in which the additional 8 bits are discarded before the key generation process begins.

## Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- In 1997, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) made a public call for a replacement for the DES algorithm.
- AES is a block cipher that operates on 128-bit blocks. 
- It is designed to be used with keys of 128, 192 or 256 bits in length, with ciphers known as: 𝑨𝑬𝑺 − 𝟏𝟐𝟖, 𝑨𝑬𝑺 − 𝟏𝟗𝟐 and 𝑨𝑬𝑺 − 𝟐𝟓𝟔.
- In early 2010, AES-256 was widely regarded as the best choice for a general purpose symmetric cryptosystem.
- The AES encryption process is done in 10 rounds.
- Each round performs a transformation on a 128-bit array, called a state.
- The initial state 𝑿𝟎 is the plaintext 𝑿𝑶𝑹 with a key 𝑲: 𝑿𝟎 = 𝑷 ⊕ 𝑲. The round 𝒊 takes the state 𝑿𝒊−𝟏 as input and produces the state 𝑿𝒊 . The ciphertext 𝑪 is the output of the final round: 𝑪 = 𝑿𝟏𝟎.
- Each round is built with four basic steps:
1. One step replacement S-box
2. A permutation step
3. A matrix multiplication step.
4. One step XOR with a round key derived from the 128-bit encryption key
