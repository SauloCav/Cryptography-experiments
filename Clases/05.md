# Introduction to modern symmetric cryptography

- Symmetric cryptography is also known as secret key cryptography.
- This encryption method uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message.
- The sender and receiver agree to use a certain key and then share it between them.

## Secure sharing
- Key sharing needs to be secure, otherwise the entire cryptographic process would be in vain.
- Note that a communication channel is required for sharing the secret key different from the channel used to transmit the encrypted message.
- Thus, one of the great problems of cryptography, known as the key distribution problem, is born.
