# Stream cipher

- A stream cipher is one that operates on a stream of data by encrypting it one bit at a time as it is transmitted or stored.
- How is it possible to encrypt an individual bit? The ciphertext is obtained by combining a bit of a keystream with a bit of plaintext using the logical XOR operation.
- Note that the function 𝑿𝑶𝑹 is perfectly balanced. That is, looking at an output value, there is exactly 𝟓𝟎% chance for any value of the input bits.

## one-time pad cipher
- The simplest and most secure type of stream cipher is the so-called one-time pad (also known as a one-time-use cipher or a one-time-key.
- The essence of the one-time pad cipher is the same as that of a Vigenère cipher, except that instead of repeating the key, one simply chooses a key as long as the plaintext.
- A one-time pad cipher uses a randomly chosen stream of keys for each cipher, and is then discarded.
- Both the encryption and decryption algorithms use a single exclusive-OR operation.
- This system was introduced by an AT&T engineer named Gilbert Vernam in 1918. He built an electromechanical machine that automatically encrypted the message.
- Your system works with binary data (bits) instead of letters. This was the first time that encryption and transmission were automated.
- A one-time pad is an ideal cipher. She is perfect!
- There is no way for an adversary to be able to guess the key or statistics from the plaintext or ciphertext.
- There is also no relationship between the plaintext and the ciphertext.
- In other words, the ciphertext is a stream of truly random bits, even if the plaintext contains some patterns.
- An attacker cannot break the cipher unless it tests all possible random key sequences, which will be 𝟐 𝒏, where the plaintext length is n bits.
- The one-time pad is the only cryptosystem that is of course 𝒏 bits proven to be completely secure.
- The problem with one-time pads is that they are very difficult to use — you need a different one-time pad for every message you send.
- So, before sending any messages, both sides have to make sure they have all the one-time pads and that they are in order.
- If they plan on sending messages repeatedly, that means they'll have to have a lot of one-time pads!
- In short, one-time pads are good in theory, but incredibly difficult to use in practice.

## What exactly is the nature of the keyflow?
- Stream ciphers produce a pseudorandom stream of bits called a keystream.
- The plaintext, ciphertext, and keystream consist of individual bits, as in the example below.
- Note that the encryption and decryption functions are the same, because they both do the same thing, i.e. XOR bits with the key stream.
- The keystream must be provided to both users in advance through some independent and secure channel. This introduces logistical problems.
- Therefore, the bitstream generator must be implemented as an algorithmic procedure, so that the cryptographic bitstream can be produced by both users.

## Practical stream ciphers
- In this approach, the bitstream generator is a key-controlled algorithm.
- The two users only need to share the generating key, and each can produce the key stream.
- To make the cipher practical, we need to replace the truly random key stream with a pseudorandom number generator, where the key 𝒌 serves as a seed.
- Generating the keystream is basically what stream ciphers are all about.
- A central requirement for keystream bits should be that they appear as a random sequence.
- Otherwise, an attacker could guess the bits and do the decryption himself.
- To generate this bit stream, we need a Pseudo-Random Number Generator.
