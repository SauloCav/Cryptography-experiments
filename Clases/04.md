# Stream cipher

- A stream cipher is one that operates on a stream of data by encrypting it one bit at a time as it is transmitted or stored.
- How is it possible to encrypt an individual bit? The ciphertext is obtained by combining a bit of a keystream with a bit of plaintext using the logical XOR operation.
- Note that the function 𝑿𝑶𝑹 is perfectly balanced. That is, looking at an output value, there is exactly 𝟓𝟎% chance for any value of the input bits.

## one-time pad cipher
- The simplest and most secure type of stream cipher is the so-called one-time pad (also known as a one-time-use cipher or a one-time-key.
- The essence of the one-time pad cipher is the same as that of a Vigenère cipher, except that instead of repeating the key, one simply chooses a key as long as the plaintext.
- A one-time pad cipher uses a randomly chosen stream of keys for each cipher, and is then discarded.
- Both the encryption and decryption algorithms use a single exclusive-OR operation.
- This system was introduced by an AT&T engineer named Gilbert Vernam in 1918. He built an electromechanical machine that automatically encrypted the message.
- Your system works with binary data (bits) instead of letters. This was the first time that encryption and transmission were automated.
- A one-time pad is an ideal cipher. She is perfect!
- There is no way for an adversary to be able to guess the key or statistics from the plaintext or ciphertext.
- There is also no relationship between the plaintext and the ciphertext.
- In other words, the ciphertext is a stream of truly random bits, even if the plaintext contains some patterns.
- An attacker cannot break the cipher unless it tests all possible random key sequences, which will be 𝟐 𝒏, where the plaintext length is n bits.
- The one-time pad is the only cryptosystem that is of course 𝒏 bits proven to be completely secure.
- The problem with one-time pads is that they are very difficult to use — you need a different one-time pad for every message you send.
- So, before sending any messages, both sides have to make sure they have all the one-time pads and that they are in order.
- If they plan on sending messages repeatedly, that means they'll have to have a lot of one-time pads!
- In short, one-time pads are good in theory, but incredibly difficult to use in practice.

## What exactly is the nature of the keyflow?
- Stream ciphers produce a pseudorandom stream of bits called a keystream.
- The plaintext, ciphertext, and keystream consist of individual bits, as in the example below.
- Note that the encryption and decryption functions are the same, because they both do the same thing, i.e. XOR bits with the key stream.
- The keystream must be provided to both users in advance through some independent and secure channel. This introduces logistical problems.
- Therefore, the bitstream generator must be implemented as an algorithmic procedure, so that the cryptographic bitstream can be produced by both users.

## Practical stream ciphers
- In this approach, the bitstream generator is a key-controlled algorithm.
- The two users only need to share the generating key, and each can produce the key stream.
- To make the cipher practical, we need to replace the truly random key stream with a pseudorandom number generator, where the key 𝒌 serves as a seed.
- Generating the keystream is basically what stream ciphers are all about.
- A central requirement for keystream bits should be that they appear as a random sequence.
- Otherwise, an attacker could guess the bits and do the decryption himself.
- To generate this bit stream, we need a Pseudo-Random Number Generator.

##  Pseudorandom Number Generators - PRNG
- In essence, there are two fundamental strategies for generating random bits or random numbers: <br>
• The first computes bits deterministically using an algorithm. This technique is known as pseudorandom number generators (PRNG) or deterministic random bit generators. <br>
• The second is to produce bits nondeterministically using some physical source that produces some sort of random output. This technique is known as true random number generators.

## Principles of pseudorandom number generation
- There are two distinct and not necessarily compatible requirements for a sequence of random numbers: randomness and unpredictability: <br>
• Randomness: The concern in generating a sequence of supposedly random numbers has been that the sequence of numbers is random in some well-defined statistical sense. Uniform distribution: The distribution of bits in the sequence must be uniform; that is, the frequency of occurrence of ones and zeros should be approximately equal. Independence: No subsequences in the sequence can be inferred from the others. <br>
• Unpredictability: In some cryptographic applications, the requirement is not just that the sequence of numbers be statistically random, but that successive members of the sequence be unpredictable. The idea here is the same, care must be taken that an opponent is not able to predict future sequence elements based on previous elements.
Seeds: <br>
• The seed that serves as input to the PRNG must be secure. • Since PRNG is a deterministic algorithm, if the adversary can deduce the seed, then the output can also be determined. <br>
• Therefore, the seed must be unpredictable (random).
- There are two main categories of PRNG: <br>
• Purpose-built algorithms: Are used in various PRNG applications, or are specifically designed for use in stream ciphers. <br>
• Algorithms based on existing cryptographic algorithms: Symmetric Block Ciphers, Asymmetric Ciphers, Hash Functions and Message Authentication Codes.
