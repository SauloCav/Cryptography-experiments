# Block ciphers

- All classical ciphers, i.e., prior to 1970, are symmetrical in nature and share some principles with modern ciphers.
- Symmetric cryptography is one in which both the sender and receiver use the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message. It is also known as secret key cryptography.
- The traditional symmetric key ciphers studied so far are character-oriented ciphers.
- With the emergence of the computer, we started to need bit-oriented ciphers.
- The reason is that the information to be encrypted does not just involve text; it can also involve numbers, graphics, audio and video data.
- A block cipher is one in which a block of plaintext is treated as a whole and used to produce a block of ciphertext of equal
length.
- Typically, a block size of 64 or 128 bits is used.
- Encryption algorithm (𝑬): <br>
• Takes a key, 𝑲, and a block of plaintext, 𝑷, and produces a block of ciphertext, 𝑪. <br>
• We denote the encryption process as: 𝑪 = 𝑬 𝑲,𝑷 .
- Decryption algorithm (𝑫). <br>
• It is the inverse of the encryption algorithm and decrypts a message to the original plaintext, 𝑷. <br>
• We denote the decoding process as: 𝑷 = 𝑫(𝑲, 𝑪) .
- The decryption algorithm must be the inverse of the encryption algorithm

## Block cipher principles
- A block cipher operates on a 𝒏-bit block of plaintext to produce a 𝒏-bit block of ciphertext.
- There are 𝟐 𝒏 possible plaintext blocks and 𝟐 𝒏 ciphertext blocks of length 𝒏.
- For the transformation to be reversible, each block must produce a unique ciphertext block.
- If the message is less than 𝒏 bits, padding bits must be added to complete a block.
- If the message has more than 𝒏 bits, it must be divided into blocks of 𝒏 bits and the padding bits must be added to the last block.

## General scheme of a block cipher
- Modern block ciphers are substitution ciphers when looking at an entire block.
- However, modern block ciphers are not designed as a single unit.
- A modern block cipher is designed as a combination of transposition units and substitution units.
- Consider a general substitution cipher for 𝒏 = 𝟒 (4-bit blocks): <br>
• A 𝟒-bit input corresponds to one of 𝟏𝟔 possible input blocks. <br>
• Each input block is mapped by the substitution cipher to one of the 𝟏𝟔 possible output blocks. <br>
• However, the ciphertext on the side is only one of the possible permutations. <br>
• That is, there are 𝟐 𝒏 ! possible transformations.

## What's the key?
- In this scheme, choosing a key means selecting a permutation between the 𝟐 𝒏 ! possible permutations. This permutation is then used to encrypt the plaintext blocks.
- How to choose the permutation: <br>
• We could try enumerating all the permutations and then randomly select an index (that index would be the key). <br>
• Thus, we need 𝐥𝐨𝐠𝟐(𝟐 𝒏 !) bits to store the key. <br>
• For a block length 𝒏 = 𝟔𝟒 bits, we would need approximately 𝟐𝟔𝟕 bytes to store a single key.
- When mapping is key: <br>
• Consider cipher where 𝒏 = 𝟒 . <br>
• The mapping can be defined by the values in the second line that show the ciphertext value for each plaintext. 
- This is the most general form of block cipher, as it allows the maximum number of cryptographic mappings from the plaintext block — this is the ideal block cipher.
- However, the ideal block cipher is not practical from an implementation and performance standpoint.
- In considering these difficulties, Feistel (German mathematician and cryptographer) pointed out that an approximation of the ideal block cipher system for large 𝒏 is needed.

## The Feistel Cipher
- Many symmetric block cipher algorithms in use today are based on a structure known as a Feistel block cipher.
- Feistel proposed that we can approximate the ideal block cipher using the concept of a product cipher.
- Product cipher is the execution of two or more simple ciphers in sequence in such a way that the final result or product is cryptographically stronger than any of the component ciphers.
