# Classical symmetric ciphers

## Number theory
- The most important branch of mathematics for the cryptography is number theory.
- Some of the theorems and proofs in number theory were already included in Euclid's classic work Elements.
- Euclid — Greek mathematician who lived in Alexandria around 300 BC.

## Prime numbers
- Prime numbers have piqued the interest of mathematicians since ancient Greece.
- In the modern era, prime numbers are of utmost importance for cryptography.
- An integer 𝑝 > 1 is called a prime if its only positive factors are 1 and 𝑝 itself.
- An integer 𝑛 > 1 that is not prime is called a composite.
- Fundamental theorem of arithmetic: Every positive integer 𝑛 > 1 can be uniquely written (except for the order of the factors) as the product of prime numbers.
- Euclid of Alexandria proved, in the third century BC, that there are infinitely many prime numbers.
- There is no pattern in the formation of prime numbers.
