# Classical symmetric ciphers

## Number theory
- The most important branch of mathematics for the cryptography is number theory.
- Some of the theorems and proofs in number theory were already included in Euclid's classic work Elements.
- Euclid — Greek mathematician who lived in Alexandria around 300 BC.

## Prime numbers
- Prime numbers have piqued the interest of mathematicians since ancient Greece.
- In the modern era, prime numbers are of utmost importance for cryptography.
- An integer 𝑝 > 1 is called a prime if its only positive factors are 1 and 𝑝 itself.
- An integer 𝑛 > 1 that is not prime is called a composite.
- Fundamental theorem of arithmetic: Every positive integer 𝑛 > 1 can be uniquely written (except for the order of the factors) as the product of prime numbers.
- Euclid of Alexandria proved, in the third century BC, that there are infinitely many prime numbers.
- There is no pattern in the formation of prime numbers.

## Modular arithmetic
- Almost all encryption algorithms are based on arithmetic within a finite set of elements.
- This technique of performing arithmetic on a finite set of integers is known as modular arithmetic.
- But is it possible to perform arithmetic operations only within the limits of the sets ℤ𝑛? The answer is yes.
- Modular arithmetic is a system of congruence arithmetic — that is, it operates on the remainders of integers divided by a fixed value, the modulus.
- (Congruence relation). Given a positive integer 𝑛, called the modulus, two integers 𝑎 and 𝑏 are said to be congruent modulo 𝒏, if 𝑛 divides the difference 𝑎 − 𝑏. This is written as: 𝑎 ≡ 𝑏 (mod 𝑛).
- Saying that 𝑎 ≡ 𝑏 (mod 𝑛) is equivalent to saying that 𝑎 and 𝑏 leave the same remainder when divided by 𝑛.
- In modular arithmetic, if two numbers 𝑎 and 𝑏 are congruent, then we consider 𝑎 and 𝑏 equal.
- (waste class). A class of residuals consists of all integers with the same remainder when divided by 𝒏, such as 𝑥 = 𝑎 ∈ ℤ 𝑎 ≡ 𝑥 (mod 𝑛)}
- Of all the integers in a residue class, the smallest non-negative is the one normally used to represent it.
- The class represented by the number 2 is exactly the set of integers that are congruent with 2 modulo 4.

- The two basic building blocks of all encryption techniques are substitution and transposition.
