# Classical symmetric ciphers

## Number theory
- The most important branch of mathematics for the cryptography is number theory.
- Some of the theorems and proofs in number theory were already included in Euclid's classic work Elements.
- Euclid — Greek mathematician who lived in Alexandria around 300 BC.

## Prime numbers
- Prime numbers have piqued the interest of mathematicians since ancient Greece.
- In the modern era, prime numbers are of utmost importance for cryptography.
- An integer 𝑝 > 1 is called a prime if its only positive factors are 1 and 𝑝 itself.
- An integer 𝑛 > 1 that is not prime is called a composite.
- Fundamental theorem of arithmetic: Every positive integer 𝑛 > 1 can be uniquely written (except for the order of the factors) as the product of prime numbers.
- Euclid of Alexandria proved, in the third century BC, that there are infinitely many prime numbers.
- There is no pattern in the formation of prime numbers.

## Modular arithmetic
- Almost all encryption algorithms are based on arithmetic within a finite set of elements.
- This technique of performing arithmetic on a finite set of integers is known as modular arithmetic.
- But is it possible to perform arithmetic operations only within the limits of the sets ℤ𝑛? The answer is yes.
- Modular arithmetic is a system of congruence arithmetic — that is, it operates on the remainders of integers divided by a fixed value, the modulus.
- (Congruence relation). Given a positive integer 𝑛, called the modulus, two integers 𝑎 and 𝑏 are said to be congruent modulo 𝒏, if 𝑛 divides the difference 𝑎 − 𝑏. This is written as: 𝑎 ≡ 𝑏 (mod 𝑛).
- Saying that 𝑎 ≡ 𝑏 (mod 𝑛) is equivalent to saying that 𝑎 and 𝑏 leave the same remainder when divided by 𝑛.
- In modular arithmetic, if two numbers 𝑎 and 𝑏 are congruent, then we consider 𝑎 and 𝑏 equal.
- (waste class). A class of residuals consists of all integers with the same remainder when divided by 𝒏, such as 𝑥 = 𝑎 ∈ ℤ 𝑎 ≡ 𝑥 (mod 𝑛)}
- Of all the integers in a residue class, the smallest non-negative is the one normally used to represent it.
- The class represented by the number 2 is exactly the set of integers that are congruent with 2 modulo 4.

## Symmetric ciphers

- The two basic building blocks of all encryption techniques are substitution and transposition.
- Monoalphabetic Cipher: A monoalphabetic cipher is any cipher in which plaintext letters are mapped to ciphertext letters based on a single alphabetic key. Examples of monoalphabetic ciphers would include the Caesar-shift cipher, where each letter is shifted based on a numeric key, and the atbash cipher, where each letter is mapped to the letter symmetric to it about the center of the alphabet.
- Polyalphabetic Cipher: A polyalphabetic cipher is any substitution-based cipher, using multiple substitution alphabets. The Vigenère cipher is probably the best-known example of a polyalphabetic cipher, although it is a simplified special case.

## Monoalphabetic Substitution Ciphers
- The oldest and simplest substitution cipher is credited to Julius Caesar. The cipher, which became known as the Caesar cipher, involves replacing each letter of the alphabet with the letter three places down.
