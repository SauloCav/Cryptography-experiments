# Classical symmetric ciphers

## Number theory
- The most important branch of mathematics for the cryptography is number theory.
- Some of the theorems and proofs in number theory were already included in Euclid's classic work Elements.
- Euclid — Greek mathematician who lived in Alexandria around 300 BC.

## Prime numbers
- Prime numbers have piqued the interest of mathematicians since ancient Greece.
- In the modern era, prime numbers are of utmost importance for cryptography.
- An integer 𝑝 > 1 is called a prime if its only positive factors are 1 and 𝑝 itself.
- An integer 𝑛 > 1 that is not prime is called a composite.
- Fundamental theorem of arithmetic: Every positive integer 𝑛 > 1 can be uniquely written (except for the order of the factors) as the product of prime numbers.
- Euclid of Alexandria proved, in the third century BC, that there are infinitely many prime numbers.
- There is no pattern in the formation of prime numbers.

## Modular arithmetic
- Almost all encryption algorithms are based on arithmetic within a finite set of elements.
- This technique of performing arithmetic on a finite set of integers is known as modular arithmetic.
- But is it possible to perform arithmetic operations only within the limits of the sets ℤ𝑛? The answer is yes.
- Modular arithmetic is a system of congruence arithmetic — that is, it operates on the remainders of integers divided by a fixed value, the modulus.
- (Congruence relation). Given a positive integer 𝑛, called the modulus, two integers 𝑎 and 𝑏 are said to be congruent modulo 𝒏, if 𝑛 divides the difference 𝑎 − 𝑏. This is written as: 𝑎 ≡ 𝑏 (mod 𝑛).
- Saying that 𝑎 ≡ 𝑏 (mod 𝑛) is equivalent to saying that 𝑎 and 𝑏 leave the same remainder when divided by 𝑛.
- In modular arithmetic, if two numbers 𝑎 and 𝑏 are congruent, then we consider 𝑎 and 𝑏 equal.
- (waste class). A class of residuals consists of all integers with the same remainder when divided by 𝒏, such as 𝑥 = 𝑎 ∈ ℤ 𝑎 ≡ 𝑥 (mod 𝑛)}
- Of all the integers in a residue class, the smallest non-negative is the one normally used to represent it.
- The class represented by the number 2 is exactly the set of integers that are congruent with 2 modulo 4.

## Symmetric ciphers
- The two basic building blocks of all encryption techniques are substitution and transposition.
- Monoalphabetic Cipher: A monoalphabetic cipher is any cipher in which plaintext letters are mapped to ciphertext letters based on a single alphabetic key. Examples of monoalphabetic ciphers would include the Caesar-shift cipher, where each letter is shifted based on a numeric key, and the atbash cipher, where each letter is mapped to the letter symmetric to it about the center of the alphabet.
- Polyalphabetic Cipher: A polyalphabetic cipher is any substitution-based cipher, using multiple substitution alphabets. The Vigenère cipher is probably the best-known example of a polyalphabetic cipher, although it is a simplified special case.

## Monoalphabetic Substitution Ciphers
- The oldest and simplest substitution cipher is credited to Julius Caesar. The cipher, which became known as the Caesar cipher, involves replacing each letter of the alphabet with the letter three places down.
- The Cesar cipher, although simple, is a cryptosystem.
- A cryptographic system is a pair of algorithms, one for converting from plaintext to ciphertext and the other for converting from ciphertext to plaintext.
- The protocol for transforming the message. In this case, it consists of replacing a letter with another that is in front of it.
- A specific key. In the case of the Caesar cipher, the key is 3 — i.e., each letter must be replaced by the letter that is three positions ahead.
- Monoalphabetic ciphers are easy to crack because they reflect the relative frequency data of the letters in the original alphabet.

## Polyalphabetic substitution ciphers
- In a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, each plaintext letter is replaced by more than one cipher letter, making the job more difficult for the cryptanalyst.
- The Vigenère cipher, created in the 16th century, is the best-known polyalphabetic cipher and one of the simplest. • This cipher is similar to the Caesar cipher, except that the letters are not shifted by a fixed amount.
- In the case of the Vigenère cipher, the shift value changes for each letter defined by a key.
- The key is a simple collection of letters that represent numbers based on their position in the alphabet.
- Stated another way, the set of substitution rules consists of the 26 Caesar cipher alphabets, with shifts from 0 to 25.

## transposition ciphers
- A different type of cipher is obtained by performing some sort of permutation on the plaintext letters. This technique is called a transposition cipher.
- A permutation is a finite set of 𝑺-elements in an ordered sequence of all 𝑺-elements, with each appearing exactly once.
- There are n! permutations of a set of n elements, because the first element can be chosen in one of n ways, the second in n - 1 ways, the third in n - 2 ways, and so on.
- Note that! A transposition cipher does not substitute one symbol for another; in fact, it modifies the location of the symbols.
- A symbol in the first position of the plaintext may appear in the tenth position of the ciphertext. Transposition Ciphers In other words, a transposition cipher reorders (transposes) the symbols.
- Rail fence cipher is a technique in which plaintext is written as a sequence of diagonals and then read as a sequence of lines—as if we were running diagonally up and down the rails of a fence.
- The rail fence cipher is not very secure, because there are not many possible keys.
- Note that it doesn't make much sense if the length of the key is greater than the length of the plaintext.
- In this way, the number of possible keys can easily be verified by computer, or even by hand.
